Hi and Welcome to my Blockchain Bootcamp Graduation project.

# dEX- De-centralised Cryptocurrency Exchange

In this DApp or De-centralised application, you can trade ERC20 type Cryptocurrencies.

You might have seen advertised or used before traditional Cryptocurrency Exchanges like CoinBase or Binance, which are running on traditional web-servers and they have a back-end database, where you deposit your founds into that Exchange, and they have complete control over it and can be changed at anytime.  

What makes this Exchange different from other Cryptocurrency exchanges is that it runs completely on the Blockchain and powered by Smart Contracts.

In this project I have coded out the smart contracts for the Cryptocurrency Exchange and created a front-end website that talks to those smart contracts, so users can trade Cryptocurrencys in a De-Centralised way.

Please be aware, not all features are fully functional at the moment, and this project to be continued ...

Kind regards, 
Szabika Veres
