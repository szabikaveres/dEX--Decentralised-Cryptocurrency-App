# dEX- De-centralised Cryptocurrency Exchange

Welcome to the dEX DApp! This decentralized application allows you to trade ERC20 type Cryptocurrencys in a De-Centralised way.


You might have seen advertised or used before traditional Cryptocurrency Exchanges like CoinBase or Binance, which are running on traditional web-servers and they have a back-end database, where you deposit your founds into that Exchange, and they have complete control over it and can be changed at anytime.  

What makes this Exchange different from other Cryptocurrency exchanges is that it runs completely on the Blockchain and powered by Smart Contracts.

In this project I have coded out the smart contracts for the Cryptocurrency Exchange and created a front-end website that talks to those smart contracts, so users can trade Cryptocurrencys in a De-Centralised way.
